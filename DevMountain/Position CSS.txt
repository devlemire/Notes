Position CSS

A positioned element is an element whose computed position is either relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky

top, right, bottom, and left properties specify the position of positioned elements

static - Let's the element use the normal behavior of being laid out in its current position in the flow
relative - Adjusts the elements position without changing the layout of the page. Appears normally in the flow and then adjusts to
           specified values (top, right, bottom, left)
absolute - Does not take space in the flow and is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. Parent must have position set to relative
fixed - Positioned relative to the container it is sitting in. Does not move when scrolling
sticky - Positioning hybrid of relative and fixed positioning


Absolute allows you to move an element relative to the container it is sitting in. Therefore to use absolute positioning, you must
set the parent's container position to relative.
