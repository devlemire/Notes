Four rules for by which context is decided. In other words what 'this' points to. Determined at invocation.
  Explicit
  Implicit
  Default/Window
  New


Order of how 'this' checks to see how it was assigned or 'pointed at'
  Explicit
  Implicit
  Default/Window

explicit assigning of 'this' This methods invoke functions and assign context
  call      -       someFunction.call(thisContext, p1, p2, pN);
  bind      -       var newFunction = someFunction.bind(thisContext);  //Parameters cannot be determined in this bind
  apply     -       someFunction.apply(thisContext, [p1, p2, pN]);


implicit assigning is 'left of the dot'
  obj.doSomething();
